# Hand-gesture-virtual-mouse
A virtual mouse using hand gesture recognition is a Python application that tracks hand landmarks with MediaPipe Hands and maps intuitive gestures to mouse actions (move, click, drag, scroll) in real time via OpenCV video frames and OS mouse control libraries. It enables touchless interaction by converting recognized gestures.
